This project analyzes a restaurant dataset to uncover customer preferences, predict ratings, and explore trends using data science techniques.

## ✅ Task 1: Predictive Modeling

🔍 **Goal**: Build regression models to predict the restaurant's `Aggregate rating` using available features.

### 🔧 Models Used:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics:
- R² Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### ✅ Outcome:
Random Forest performed the best with the highest accuracy and lowest error.

## ✅ Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis

🔍 **Goal**: Understand customer preferences based on:
- Cuisine type
- Votes (popularity)
- Average rating

### 📌 Key Insights:
- Cuisines like **North Indian**, **Chinese**, and **Fast Food** had the most votes.
- **Italian**, **Continental**, and **Japanese** cuisines had higher average ratings.
- Popular cuisines don’t always have the highest ratings – satisfaction ≠ popularity.

## ✅ Task 3: Data Visualization

🔍 **Goal**: Visualize rating distribution and explore feature relationships.

### 📊 Charts Created:
- Histogram & Count Plot of `Aggregate rating`
- Bar charts for top cuisines & cities by rating
- Scatterplot of `Votes` vs `Rating`
- Boxplot of `Price Range` vs `Rating`

### 📌 Insights:
- Most restaurants have ratings between **3.0 and 4.5**.
- **Price range** doesn’t always guarantee a better rating.
- Cities like **Bangalore**, **New Delhi**, and **Gurgaon** had strong average ratings.
